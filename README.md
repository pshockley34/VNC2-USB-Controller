Vincullum-II (VNC2) V2DIP1-32 USB Controller

The program will read names from a .csv file that is on a USB Flash Drive. The names are then sent to a microcontroller that is connected to LEDs, which are used as nametags for mailboxes. The main goal of the project is to lower the burden on the secretaries who have been using paper nametags for the mailboxes which they have to remove and replace in alphabetical order anytime a new mailbox owner comes in or someone leaves. This will make it easy for the secretaries as all they will have to do now is change the names in the .csv file and the USB Controller and Microcontroller do the rest.
